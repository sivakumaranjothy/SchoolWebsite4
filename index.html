            <h5 class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 ">December 4-10,2017 , many schools around the world took part in an annual event called The Hour of Code. The Hour of Code is a yearly event to introduce people from the ages of 4 to 104 to computer science. Today tens of millions of students in over 180 countries have taken part in coding activities. At Stonebridge, four intermediate students created, gave presentations and ran workshops for a handful of students in Grade 5 to introduce coding to students. Thank you for your leadership, Dylan Z., James L, Kevin S. and William L. These intermediate students created a power point presentation to explain what coding was and they supervised students who were working at their own rate on the website code.org Parents, you and your children may begin or continue to learn about coding at home. Go to code.org or hourofcode.org to find out more details. Happy coding, everyone!

            <h5 class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 ">The third phase of the work-to-rule strike sanctions add to the sanctions announced in phase two in December. While previous sanctions were mostly administrative in nature, during the third phase, students and families will begin to notice some activities being withdrawn. Of note, the phase 3 work-to-rule strike sanctions will mean that elementary school teachers across public schools in Ontario will:Not participate in extra-curricular activities, except for those scheduled within the school day. Not participate in field trips. Not arrive at school any earlier than 30 minutes before the start of the day, and not stay later than 15 minutes after the end of the day. Not participate in assemblies, except to provide student supervision. ETFO also announced phase four strike sanctions, effective January 20. In phase four, ETFO has announced that teachers will participate in rotating one-day strikes if a deal is not reached. We do not yet have details on the timing of the rotating strike which will impact schools at the York Region District School Board and will provide information as early as possible. The full list of sanctions by ETFO is available on the Board’s website. We know this is disappointing for students and families. Your child’s school will provide additional information regarding extra-curricular activities, events and field trips that may have to be cancelled as a result of this work-to-rule strike action. Student safety continues to be our priority and we continue to make contingency plans and work to minimize the impact of labour sanctions on students.We will continue to keep families updated. You can find updates and information about labour issues on the Board website: www.yrdsb.ca. You may also follow our Twitter account for more immediate updates: @yrdsb.
